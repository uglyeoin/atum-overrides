# atum-overrides
CSS overrides for the Joomla Atum Administration Template.

Use as you see fit.  

You may wish to change the variable names.  I use variables like this as I find them descriptive.  I got the idea from https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors

There's a change you may prefer to use something like `--main-colour`

For me I'm happy to keep all websites with my brand colours, you may wish to change them for each client potentially.

Using more generic variables like `--main-colour` would make sense on those occasions.

Comment if you find it useful :)

Atum sizes for images in the admin :)

# Main logo when logged in
266px x 66px - padding 12px x 5px = 
266px-(12 x 2px = 24px) = 242px
66px - (2 x 5px = 10px) = 56px
242px x 56px;

# Main Logo Small
20px x 20px

# Login Logo
340px x 70px
